# CyberOps XMPP and OWASP Mutillidae II.


Welcome to the first installer for XMPP version 7.4.5 and OWASP Mutillidae II version 2.6.67 under CyberOps Linux.
This is not an offcial fork of any other XAMPP, OWSAP or Cyberops repos. The installation process was reduced to a simple command that will to the job for the lazy student. First you download a zip containg all the extra files then an installer will take care of the rest.
## Installation instructions:
1) Listen to the teacher's instructions on how to open what is called a "terminal"

2) Now copy and paste the command below (everything from wget to install.sh) and press "ENTER".


`wget --load-cookies /tmp/cookies.txt "https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&confirm=$(wget --quiet --save-cookies /tmp/cookies.txt --keep-session-cookies --no-check-certificate 'https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1qRPPjEFJ0eVdA6jouU3ywMC1F_suxUJu' -O- | sed -rn 's/.*confirm=([0-9A-Za-z_]+).*/\1\n/p')&id=1qRPPjEFJ0eVdA6jouU3ywMC1F_suxUJu" -O cyber.zip && rm -rf /tmp/cookies.txt && 7z x cyber.zip && cd cyber && sudo -S <<< "cyberops"  chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
`

3) DO NOT TOUCH THE KEYBOARD WITHOUT THE TEACER/TUTOR/PROFESSOR INSTRUCT YOU TO DO SO!!

## Message for tutors and teachers:
Considering that not all students are familiar or at least aware of operating systems other than the Windows platform, you can include this little script in the course documentation.

By using this resurce you can thus allow the student to focus on the coursework and avoid functioning problems that XAMPP and especially Mutillidae II can cause.
